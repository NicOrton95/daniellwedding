Final touches:
	Add white shadow to the top of the footer section
	Add a hover zoom transition to the gallery images
	Remove/replace gallery images whose sizes don't fit in with the rest of it
	Make all text a lil smaller on the mobile version
	All headers need a reduced margin/padding from the top - too much space above them, doesn't match the rest
	Add reception details
	Rewrite the Our Story part to have actual details


Fonts Info:
	Header (Gen & Jason part): Imperial Script, Dancing Script
	Menu: Dancing Script (look for something a lil less cursive
		Maybe: Poppins
